meta-description: Print these A4 iPhone Sketch Sheets to quickly mock up designs for iPhone SE, 6s and 6s Plus.
---

When you're mocking up a design or an experience for the iPhone, there are three main viewports you need to consider. These are the 4" iPhone SE, the 4.7" iPhone 6s and 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus. Drawing these out every time can get a bit boring, so I've put together some A4 Sketch Sheets which include all three screen sizes at 1:1 size.

### How to use

To use the iPhone Sketch Sheets couldn't be simpler. Just download them and print them at 100% scale on A4 paper - normal or borderless. Then, find your favourite pen or pencil and get sketching.
