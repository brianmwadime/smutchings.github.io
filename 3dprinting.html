      <h3>The Future of Manufacturing</h3>
      <p>You'll see from my work and interests below that Design doesn't have to be confined to one space, and neither does a practitioner.</p>
      <p>We stand at the frontier of developing technologies and techniques that will forever change they way we design and the way we create.</p>
      <p>Those of us who accept these technologies as the opportunities they are will create a new future. One where the digital and physical worlds intermingle more than ever before. A future where what we initially believed impossible will be normal.</p>
      <p>Join me, as I explore the future of Design.</p>
