The fate of the galaxy is in your hands, as you race your friends to create (or destroy) planets. Who will be the first to 10? Introducing Space Dice.

I worked with Jon to write the copy for the:

- [Space Dice website](www.spacedice.com)
- Space Dice Rules printout
- Space Dice Shopify email shots

As well as a script for the Space Dice marketing video.
