James of Realising Designs asked me to give a fresh feel to the copy for his company’s website. Based in Whitstable and Canterbury, in my home county of Kent in England, we focussed the copy on local businesses and the benefits Realising Designs can bring them. Check out the full site at http://www.realisingdesigns.com.

James, Realising Designs:

>Sam was a pleasure to work with on our website copy project (www.realisingdesigns.com). He provided great results, on-time and valuable inputs throughout – highly recommended.
