Spark is a new app for managing your email on the go. Quickly see which emails are important with a smart inbox that auto-sorts email based on who it’s from and what it’s about. Reply to email with just a tap, using Quick Replies. Be notified only when you receive an important email with Smart Notifications. Even deal with email from your wrist with Smart Notifications, Quick Replies and Dictation on Apple Watch.

Readdle asked me to help with the copy for their App launch endeavours. This involved writing and reviewing:

- [The Spark app website](https://readdle.com/products/spark)
- [iOS App Store description](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/spark-fast-smart-email-for/id997102246?mt=8)
- App UI copy
- Onboarding emails
- Spark Press Pack
- [Launch blog post](https://readdle.com/blog/2015/05/introducing-spark/)

On the first day of release, Spark achieved **over 50,000 downloads** from the iOS App Store.

>Sam did a great job working with us on the copy for Spark. He was very responsive, reliable and managed to turn tech terms into words that all people would understand.
