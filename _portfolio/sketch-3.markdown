I had the pleasure of consulting with the [Bohemian Coding](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) team on their Mac App Store description for their Sketch 3 graphic design program. I helped simplify and clearly communicate their application for millions of prospective users. By showcasing the benefits of Sketch, we were able to increase engagement and ultimately grow the apps potential for popularity.

The app quickly reached #1 on the Mac App Store charts, and was featured (including an excerpt of the app store description) on [Cult of Mac](http://www.cultofmac.com/274580/design-app-called-sketch-3-top-mac-app-store-heres/).
