 [Dockbit](https://dockbit.com) makes it easy for teams, technical and non-technical alike, to deploy software without fear. Optimised for modern workflows, including ChatOps for deployment through Slack, it's a whole new way to deploy to the web, so they needed some help when it came to getting their message across.

I've worked regularly with Dockbit through 2016 to help Tair and his team communicate effectively with potential customers, local communities, and investors. And I continue to work with them as a communication consultant as they prepare to launch their paid-for offerings.
