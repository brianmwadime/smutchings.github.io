I was asked to write the copy for a one-off email shot for Lexus. The team was changing the email from which the newsletter would be coming from, and they need their subscribers to take steps to make sure this email didnâ€™t go into their spam folders. I was tasked with writing copy to convince subscribers to take this step, and to sell the benefits of continuing the subscribe to the newsletter.
