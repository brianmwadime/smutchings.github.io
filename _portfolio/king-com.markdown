Working with the Community team at [King.com](http://company.king.com/), a leading interactive entertainment company for the mobile world, I created a series of miscellaneous communications to help drive player engagement across a selection of their games. This copy includes:

- Emails to announce special events.
- Push notifications to drive player engagement and announce special events.
- A2U notifications (delivered through Facebook) to drive player engagement and announce special events.

The [King.com](http://company.king.com/) team were incredibly happy with the work I produced and the speed with which I was able to adopt and use their brand and writing style in new and exciting ways.
