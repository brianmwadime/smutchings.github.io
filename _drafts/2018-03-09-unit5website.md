#### A new design for a new direction

For the last 10 years, I've primarily worked as a copywriter, helping tech companies across the globe communicate more effectively with their customers. But now, I'm taking on a change in career. I'm becoming a designer. To match this change in career, and to give my portfolio a more personal touch, I redesigned and recoded my website for Unit 5 of my Art and Creative Design course at college.

The rest of this post will be a PDF, a writeup of the process I undertook and the results. If you'd like to download this PDF for later, you can do so here.
