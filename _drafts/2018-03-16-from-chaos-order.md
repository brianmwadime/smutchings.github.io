For years, I felt a little out of place. Like I was the only one trying to create order from the chaos I saw each and every day. That I was the only one who saw all the problems and cared enough to spend time thinking about them.

As time went by, I realised I wasn’t out of place. And that I wasn’t the only one. What I realised is that I am a Designer. Someone who looks at the world with curiosity and wonders why things are how they are and what could be done to improve the way things are.

As I looked into design, I found more and more people who see the world in the same way. People, often no smarter than me, who are doing great work each and every day to make the world a better place.

Jonathan Ive, Dieter Rams, Marc Newson, Steve Jobs, Norman Foster, Elon Musk, Don Norman. These people, and many more, are my inspirations.

“From Chaos, Order” explores the creative process of design, showing that ordered products often emerge from chaotic beginnings. In each of the projects on show, all my own work, chaos and uncertainty have been harnessed and moulded into an ordered, defined end.
