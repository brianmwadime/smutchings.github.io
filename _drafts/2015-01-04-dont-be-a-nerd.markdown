title: Don't be a Nerd!
---
2015 started reflective. I decided to merge all my photos into a single iPhoto library. So apart from ~90GB "casual" pictures and holiday photos, I added my ~90GB Aperture library from my semi-professional photographer career.

While processing all the thumbnails and faces, some friends walked in and saw the first pictures of me in the overview. Their reaction was as expected: "OH MY GOD THAT WAS YOU???".

The first pictures I have are from 2004, more than 10 years ago now:

Reflecting on that: I was a chubby, long haired nerd ("langhaariger Bombenleger" as Germans say) with an original Matrix long coat and not very liked by general audience. In short: A real nerd. Pretty much no success with women, low self esteem and a life in front of the screen.

I can't express how unhappy I really was in time and even with the first girlfriend, I wasted 3.5 years in an unhappy relationship wondering if that's it in life.

After getting my heart broken the first time, it was time to change.

The most obvious thing to change was the hair cut. From ~50cm to wet shaved 0mm in 30 minutes. Going the "bad boy" road was the easiest path at first and leads to self-esteem, fun and higher success rates with dating hot women.

But walking a path that's not your true you, you'll trap yourself at some point, as you're pretty much lying to other people, leading to broken friendships and broken hearts.

So apart from changing the outside, you'll have to work on your self. I'm not saying stop role playing, LARPing, spending nights in front of the screen programming cool stuff or on LAN parties shooting your virtual enemies. I'm not saying stop listing to your favorite bands just because they're not mainstream. But stop putting that sign on your forehead (by that I mean dressing and obviously looking like a nerd). Improve your people skills should be the first item on your list.
