I hate bars. They're loud and filled with people all wanting to order their next drink. Often after already having one or two too many. The bad pairing of this loud, crowded venue with the lossy communication form that is conversation seems like a match made in hell. Can we make it better?

## CHATBOT ALL THE THINGS!

If you've spoken with me recently, you'll know that I am not a believer that everything and everyone can be replaced with a chatbot. After a decade working with people and customers, I'm well aware that the technology is nowhere near advanced enough to replace the capabilities of a human agent or server.

I just wanted to make that clear before you read this post and thought "Well, chatbots are the fun fad...".

## What are the problems?

Design is not about making a product. It's about solving a problem. So, to begin with, we need to know the problems that are present when ordering a drink or other service in a loud and/or crowded venue.

I've put together the following non-exhaustive list of the problems I see with the current "interface":

- Staff being able to hear customers
- Customers being able to hear staff
- Staff knowing in which order to serve customers
- Customers getting the attention of staff
- Customers knowing which drinks are available
- Staff knowing exactly how a customer wants their drink
- Processing payment (especially if card)
