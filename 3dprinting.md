    <h3>3D Printing</h3>
    <p>Nearly 30 years after the advent of fused disposition modeling (FDM), the core technology used by the majority of modern 3D printers, we are now coming to a point where 3D printers are suitable for everyday use.</p>
    <p>Just a few years ago, 3D printing was a technique reserved for businesses, universities, and extreme hobbyists. The costs and time involved to buy or build a printer, and the time you'd need to maintain the device, made them unsuitable for use by everyday printers. Recently, however, the market has started to deliver printers that are cheaper, easier to use, and are of a higher quality.</p>
    <p>For example, the Ender 3 by Creality is a perfectly capable 3D printer for everyday use, that is available to purchase for Â£180 RRP. With this device, I've been able to bring 3D printing to Folkestone College, and introduce a new generation of makers to what many would consider to be the forefront of manufacturing.</p>
    <p>Using applications such as AutoDesk Fusion 360 and Shapr3D, I've designed and printed novel artefacts in a way that would be much more expensive and slower to do with traditional means. And we've been able to print and test in-house, allowing for quicker iteration and learning than we would achieve by outsourcing production.</p>
    <p>I see 3D printing as the future of physical prototyping. As the devices get cheaper, faster, and higher resolution, the results from 3D printing will be undiscernable from those of traditional manufacturing methods. And the speed at which they can be delivered will greatly surpass traditional techniques.</p>
