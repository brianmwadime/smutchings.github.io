          <h5 class="card-title">Hey there!</h5>
          <p class="card-text">My name is <strong>Samuel</strong>, but you can call me <strong>Sam</strong>. Welcome to my portfolio, where I'll hope you see what inspires me in design and art.</p>
          <p>The driving force behind my design is a passion to <a href="/designer">design a better world</a> for my contemporaries and those who will come after me. Through the application of ideas, great and small, to the creative process, I hope to design better things for everyone.</p>
          <p>Though, I'm just starting on my journey. After 10 years of working "in the real world", I've just gone back to college to study a <a href="https://www.eastkent.ac.uk/course/art-and-creative-design-level-3">Level 3 Diploma in Art and Creative Design at The Edge School of Creative and Business</a>. This website is the outcome of much of that learning, bringing various processes together into one designed product.</p>
          <p>I'm currently looking for freelance opportunities between now and July, 2018. Towards July, I'll be looking for full-time opportunities in the design sector, either in the UK or Berlin.</p>
          <p>I hope you enjoy the content you see here. And do <a href="mailto:hi@samhutchings.co">get in touch</a> if you think we'd design amazing things together.</p>
          <p><strong>-S</strong></p>
