#### Outline

HXWARTH (pronounced "Howarth") is a collection of streetwear by the young fashion designer Jack Howarth. Jack was looking for a new logo to better represent the collection, so I helped him put one together. Then, I used the new logo to design a couple of minimalist pieces for Jack to showcase in an upcoming photoshoot.

#### Inspirations

The HXWARTH logo is inspired by the urban environment, graffiti, and the boldness of the fonts and colours used in these environments. It is designed to be used in a variety of colour-ways, to match the mood and context of the piece.
