The LED T-Shirt was an experiment in mixing processes and media to create something original and unexpected. After learning about garment printing, electric paint, and illustrated patterns, I merged the three disciplines together into a final piece.

The shirt uses two coloured LEDs - red and green - to light up the answer and reject call buttons on an illustrated mobile phone, which has been printed on a Roland BN-20 printer and heat pressed onto the garment. They are connected in parallel to two watch batteries using electric paint. The whole apparatus is held to the t-shirt with adhesive tape, so that it can be worn close to the skin without causing iritation.

Whilst this t-shirt is currently one-of-a-kind and in the early prototyping stages, I am inspired to continue pulling on this thread to develop a range of electronic and illuminated clothing.
