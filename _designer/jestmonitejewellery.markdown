As part of my [Level 3 Art and Creative Design](http://eastkent.ac.uk/course/art-and-creative-design-level-3) course, I worked with Folkestone-based artist [Matt Rowe](http://mattroweportfolio.co.uk/) to create a series of [jesmonite](http://jesmonite.com) products as part of a material study.

The ultimate result of this process was a series of four space-inspired jesmonite pendants - called Void, Solar, Lunar and Martian.

#### Void

Multi-coloured terazzo adds a stellar quality to this dark purple jesmonite pendant, hinting to the colour-specked expanse that is the void of space.

#### Solar

Red terazzo adds heat and character to this yellow jesmonite, hinting to the warmth and light of our own sun.

#### Lunar

The cratered white landscape of this pendant hints to the pock-marked surface of our nearest stellar neighbour, the moon.

#### Martian

The bright red colouration of this pendant reminds us of the stark red surface of Mars, our planetary neighbour and potential new home.
