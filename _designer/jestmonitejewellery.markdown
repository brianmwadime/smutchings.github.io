As part of my Level 3 Art and Creative Design course, I worked with Folkestone-based artist Matt Rowe to create a series of jesmonite products as part of a material study.

The ultimate result of this process was a series of four space-inspired jesmonite pendants - called Void, Solar, Lunar and Martian.
