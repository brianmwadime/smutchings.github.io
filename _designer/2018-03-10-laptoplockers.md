### Project Outline

Working for East Kent College Technology Services alongside a fellow student, we worked to solve the real-world problem of students understanding and interacting with East Kent College’s new smart laptop locker system.

Through the application of information and visual design, we improved interaction between the students and the laptop lockers, making them a more effective learning resource for East Kent College campuses in Broadstairs, Dover and Folkestone.

> "A great job. I am really impressed with what you have completed with the laptops, and I know visitors I have shown have also been impressed. I think there is most definitely potential in taking this further across Folkestone." - Victoria Copp-Crawley, Folkestone Campus Principal

### Project Parameters

The project was bound by the following parameters:

- The resultant product had to adhere to the laptops and laptop lockers as they are used in day-to-day college life.
- The product had to be long-lasting and able to resist common environmental hazards in a college environment.
- The resultant product had to conform to new EKC Group brand guidelines, using defined campus colours, the college’s Montserrat typeface, and the font weights chosen by the college as they rebrand from East Kent College to EKC Group.
- The product had to be delivered to a pre-agreed timeline and budget, as it is a commercial application of design and is necessary for the successful roll-out of the laptop locker project.
- The product had to use resources already available to the college, as much as possible, to ensure cost-effective delivery.
- The product had to be adhered to plastic and aluminium laptops and painted doors, and be relatively easy to apply by technicians on various campuses.
- The locker product had to make it clear how to borrow or return a laptop, using language suitable for students with varying English comprehension levels.
- The laptop product had to feature instructions on how to return the laptop, as well as information on where the laptop is located, and its serial number for easy tracking and repair logging by students and the college's Technology team.
- The product had to be sized appropriately for both Lenovo and MacBook Air laptops, as the college is a mixed-platform environment.
- The product had to be delivered in a printed format and fitted by myself and Alex Lawford.

The project was considered complete once 4 locker systems and 130 laptops have had their labelling applied and spares had been produced and supplied.

### Research and Observations

Research on this project involved looking at the use of information design in the real world, as well as the cultural and material properties of stickers and their placement on laptops. This research helped to understand how words, shapes and colours are used in the real world to convey information, by looking as such mechanisms as road signage, warning labels, and ticket vending machines.

When looking at the cultural aspect of stickers and their placement on laptops and in the world, it helped to understand how the content and placement of these stickers plays a role in cultural narratives, so that we could create informational sticker products that look like they belong in the space they're designed for, instead of appearing as sticker graffiti.

Research also looked into the use of colour in informational signage - such as the use of yellow as a cautionary colour and blue to show informational signage - as well as the use of mixed-case typography and chunking to ensure legibility and understanding of content.

Observations of students using the laptop lockers without informational signage found that a large proportion of students had issues when returning the laptops. Most notably, returning the laptops in an incorrect orientation or not reconnecting the laptop to its charger once it was placed in the locker.

### Development

Once research had been undertaken, it was time to develop the design of the informational sticks for the laptops and lockers. In this instance, I started by sketching out designs for the laptop locker stickers, before creating digital and physical prototypes to test legibility and clarity of information in the space.

During this prototyping, it became clear that the client's original brief - that we have one big sticker on the clear panel nearest the locker interface - would cause issues when it came to students interacting with the lockers, as the information would be too far away from the point of interaction. Prototypes that placed the information right next to the point of interaction were more intuitive and easier to follow. Therefore, the final product would be based around this design.

When iterating on the design for the laptops, it became clear that we were dealing with two differently-sized laptops. The Lenovo product had a larger surface area than the MacBook Airs, which were both narrower and less deep than their Lenovo counterparts. This meant that we needed to design a sticker that would look good and work well on both platforms. Iterating through designs and sketching, I decided upon a modular, chevron-inspired design for the stickers, allowing for dynamism in the design as well as easy installation across a range of sizes of device, with chevrons added or removed based on the size of the device.

### Installation

Once the stickers were designed and printed, using Roland VersaWorks Dual and a BN-20 vinyl printer and cutter, it was time to install them on their respective laptops and lockers across three East Kent College campuses. Alex and I started in Folkestone, as this was our home base at the time, to make it easier for us to adapt our process and gather any tools we would need as the day progressed. Once we were comfortable with how things were at Folkestone, we were able to put together an installation toolkit that we could take to the other campuses.

This toolkit was rather simple, being made up of two application squeegees, a vinyl weeder, a utility knife, and an installation "jig" made of a 7cm piece of foamboard and a right-angled set square. This small selection of tools were all we needed to apply the stickers, and installation at each site took between 1.5 and 2.5 hours depending on the number of stickers involved and the proximity between our work area and the laptops.

### Evaluation

Overall, this project has been very successful.

Those campuses fitted with informational labelling have seen a dramatic increase in the use of the locker system and laptops by students, and a reduction in incorrect replacement of laptops into the lockers. Staff and students alike love the colourful and clear designs of the stickers.

East Kent College Technology Services are now looking to roll out the smart laptop lockers to their new Canterbury and Sheppey campuses, and they will be labelled in the same way as those systems in Dover, Folkestone and Broadstairs.
