## Project Outline

I worked for a client with a fellow student to solve the real-world problem of students understanding and interacting with East Kent Collegeâ€™s new smart laptop locker system.

Through the application of information and visual design, we improved interaction between the students and the laptop lockers, making them a more effective learning resource for East Kent College in Broadstairs, Dover and Folkestone.

The following is a PDF report created at the end of the project. It's a long read (clocking in at 25 pages), but is a good example of where I'm currently at in research and reporting.
