As part of my [Level 3 Art and Creative Design](http://eastkent.ac.uk/course/art-and-creative-design-level-3) course, I was involved in and led workshops to help design a new town, Otterpool Park, in the south-east of Kent.

#### Idea Workshops

At the beginning of the process, we worked as a group of 8-10 students, coming up with ideas for what we'd ideally like to see in a new town opening in our community.

Great ideas came from all sides about all of the different aspects of a town and how it could be an enjoyable and accessible place to live for people of all ages and abilities.

The three main themes were:

- Otterpool Park should have public spaces for people of all ages to meet, develop new relationships, and be physically and mentally healthy.
- Commercial businesses and residential spaces should exist in and around the town centre and public spaces to encourage well-serviced events which are easy for all to attend and take part in.
- Otterpool Park should be somewhere people want and can afford to live in and travel to as a destination, providing sustainable and ongoing economic and cultural growth.

These themes were carried through to the communication workshop and, later, the presentation to local business leaders and councillors.


#### Communication Workshop

The day before the presentation, I helped lead a communication workshop with the three other students who would be joining me at the meeting. This helped focus their message on the three main themes from our previous workshops, whilst also helping them gain confidence and basic skills to stand up in front of an audience and talk freely about their respective ideas and dreams.

During this workshop, we also outlined a PDF document to be created and handed out during the presentation. That evening, I produced the handout, ready for the next day.


#### Presentation

On the day of the presentation, I led the group through presenting and defending our ideas. Backing up our points with anecdotal evidence as well as evidence from other cities or research I had read whilst preparing for the presentation.

When I appropriate, I would hand over control of the meeting to one of my fellow students, based on their specialist subject and what they had previously made clear they were happy talking about.

At the beginning of the meeting, we had been given a 20-minute slot to talk about the project and field questions from local business people and councillors. By the end of the meeting, our allotted time had expanded to nearly 90 minutes, and record attendance for a last-billed topic at any meeting.
