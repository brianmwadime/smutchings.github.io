            <p class="card-text">I help companies around the world communicate better with their customers and users. And with previous clients including <a href="http://samhutchings.co/project/king-com/">King.com</a>, <a href="http://samhutchings.co/project/lexus/">Lexus</a> and <a href="http://samhutchings.co/project/typeform/">Typeform</a>; you know you're in good hands.</p>

            <p>Passionate about communication and great experiences, I bring my knowledge in both areas together to help you and your business do better. Whether that involves leading a team, joining your team, or working on my own.

            My specialities are product copy, UX copy and short-form communications such as email. So if you're looking for someone to write long-form or blog content, I'm not your guy.</p>
