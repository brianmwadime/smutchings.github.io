# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>

I've had many jobs over the last 15 years. From golf course greenskeeper to lead copywriter. But, for the last few years, I've worked hard to become a Designer and Artist, focussing on the human condition.

As a Designer, I believe in the holistic application of the Design Process to understand and resolve problems facing people everyday.

As an Artist, I look to understand the Human condition, and my own existence, through digital and physical art.
