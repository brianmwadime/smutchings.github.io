# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>
As a Designer, I believe in the holistic application of the Design Process to understand and resolve problems facing people everyday.

As an Artist, I look to understand the Human condition, and my own existence, through digital and physical art.
