As I look further into User Experience design, I realise that it's less of a one-time thing and more of an ongoing process. One that takes into account the needs and wants of both the company and the consumer to create a balanced experience for both, through iterative and regular releases.

## The Process

The process of User Experience design looks a little like this:

In this model, once the need to use a human centred design process has been identified, four activities form the main cycle of work:

**Specify the context of use** - Identify the people who will use the product, what they will use it for, and under what conditions they will use it.

**Specify requirements** - Identify any business requirements or consumer goals that must be met for the product to be a success.

**Create design solutions** - This part of the process may be done in stages, building from a rough concept through to a complete design.

**Evaluate designs** - The most important part of this process is that evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.

Once these 4 steps are completed, the process ends and the product can be released - as long as the requirements are met.

This process is followed and reiterated for each design decision, improving the product in iterative steps.
