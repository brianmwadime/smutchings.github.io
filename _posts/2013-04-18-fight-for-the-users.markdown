Customers are the most vital part of your business. You can survive without an in-house developer. You can survive by outsourcing a designer if yours leaves. You can survive if an investor decides to pull out. You can’t survive if everyone who uses your platform just ups and leaves.

Your customers aren’t always right. They don’t always know what they want. But, they do know what they like. They do decide what they are going to spend their time and money on. It’s vital that when you create a product, you create it with the end-user in mind. If they don’t like it, you don’t have a business.

## You will be Judged

Your customers will judge you. They will form an opinion of what you offer, and they will share this opinion. How you act at your worst is how your customers will perceive you.

If you’re an application, your customers will judge you on how often the app crashes. They will get annoyed with how many steps it takes to do what they want to do. They’ll be frustrated when they can’t find what they’re looking for. They’ll be looking to you for support, and they’ll be wanting you to help as much as you can.

If you’re a physical product, your customers will judge you on lifespan. They’ll be looking for the niggling points in the design, and how it affects them. They’ll shout about it when the product breaks, and they’ll be none-to-happy when they have to buy another one. They’ll often contact you last, if at all.

I think you get the point. No matter how good you can be, it’s how bad you get that people focus on.

## Be there through the bad

When your application fails, be proactive in letting your users know. Have systems in place that let you know something is wrong, before your users can tell there’s something wrong.

Test the journey through your app until it feels right, and then test it more. Let a range of people, with a range of backgrounds, get their hands on it. They’ll find what’s wrong.

Your support needs to be top-notch. They have to be clear in what they say, and empathetic to your customers. They need to communicate at your customers’ level. No talking down, and no assuming knowledge.

What happens when your product breaks? Do you let your customers deal with it, and ask them to buy a new one. Or do you go out of your way to help them. Perhaps giving them a free replacement isn’t possible, but even a discounted one can help sooth the wound.

## What I mean is…

Your users, customers, consumers, clients, whatever… They’re the lifeblood of your business. They’re who let you do what you enjoy every day. Yes they might be a massive pain in the arse from time to time, but that’s half the fun. Being there to support them, and help them through difficult times, that’s what can put a smile on your face. I know it does for me.
