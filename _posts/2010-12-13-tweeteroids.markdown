<p>For the course 'Introduction to Programming' at Leiden University I created my first game named "tweeteroids". It's a clone of the famous Asteroids game, but instead of shooting rocks you can shoot twitter user images which explode in their original twitter message. Each character of the message can still hit the ship, so it can get really tricky by the text length or the keyword which is used to filter the tweets. The game is coded in <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing.org</a>, an interactive Java environment. However, most of the work was done with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, a brilliant Java IDE. There's a guide how to implement the Processing.org libraries into another IDE <a href="http://processing.org/learning/eclipse/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>To play the game you need Processing.org of course. Download the source and generate the fonts SansSerif-8.vlw and Serif-48.vlw (there's a problem in the current version with the font environment, so I can't provide working fonts, sorry).</p>

Feel free to modify the source and improve the game.

Have fun.</p>
