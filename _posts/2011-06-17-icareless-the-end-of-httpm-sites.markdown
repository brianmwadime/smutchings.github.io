I promised to release my responsive <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> theme soon. But I realised since I'm writing my thesis, I have no time to finalise the theme. So feel free to use it as a starting point for your own developments, credit to this domain is appreciated.

<h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
You can read more about responsive design at <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">A List Apart</a>. To make it short, you don't need separate sites for mobile devices any more. So instead of having a site structure like http://m.yourdomain.com + http://www.yourdomain.com + http://pad.yourdomain.com + ... you have one site and use the CSS @media selector to distinguish between screen sizes and devices and give the user a design which is optimised for their device, from the iPod, iPhone and iPad (or similar devices, of course).

<h3>iCareLess Download</h3>
As already mentioned, iCareLess is based on the semantic HTML5 theme <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/toolbox">Toolbox</a> and the CSS framework <a href="http://lessframework.com/">Less Framework</a>. Feel free to download and use and fork the theme on GitHub. Credit to this site is appreciated if you use it. Contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/PatrickHeneise">Twitter</a> if there are any problems.
