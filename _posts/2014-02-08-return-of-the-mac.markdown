Upon his return to Apple in 1997, Steve Jobs did something drastic. He culled dozens of projects, some very close to release, so that he could focus on the future of Apple. 

That future, as he drew it on a white board, was one based on 4 words: Consumer, Pro, Desktop and Notebook. That was it, and that's what has defined the Mac product line pretty much since.

Back in 1997, this was a massive departure from the norm. Even Apple had been making dozens of different SKUs and models, appealing to every user and every scenario. They were licensing Mac OS to all and sundry, and they were floundering. Betting the whole company on 4 product lines, with devices that didn't really exist yet, and removal of the licensing business, required some guts.

But they pulled through.

## To Today

Fast forward to today, and these quadrants are still present. They just look a bit different, and are made of a lot more aluminium (yes, that's how you spell it properly :P).

![The Mac Family](/content/images/2014/Feb/Screenshot_2014_02_08_15_16_42.png)

On the consumer side, we have the unimitable iMac and ever-lasting MacBook Air. 

On the Pro side, we have the aptly named MacBook Pro with Retina Display and the ever so tiny Mac Pro.

It's a family that includes a device for every need, but without all the confusion you get from other manufacturers (and pre-'97 Apple).

*Note: I've omitted the MacBook Pro (without Retina Display) and the Mac Mini from this picture, as they muddy the waters just a little bit. The £999 MacBook Pro is primarily for education and business, and the Mac Mini tend to appeal to those looking for a Mac to play around with. (I may be wrong, who knows).*

## What's everyone jabbering about?

### Tim and Phil talk

Tim Cook and Phil Schiller have been doing the rounds recently, talking about the future of Apple and reminiscing about its past. This is quite a new tactic for Apple, and one that is raising some questions. Mainly: Why?

After the passing of Steve Jobs, the leadership at Apple has been constantly questioned. The heady days of Apple are seen by many to have passed, and that Jobs' death was the bringer of the end. Personally, I think that that opinion is wrong, but we shall see. 

Apple, and its  leadership team, are continuing to do what they always do: make great products. They're just talking about this process a little more, and it helps that this is the 30th anniversary of the Mac, so they've a lot to talk about.

As well as this trip down memory lane, some comments have come up about the future of the Mac.

From [Tim Cook](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/02/07/apple-spending-on-future-macs/):
> And we haven't given up on the Mac. A lot of people are throwing in the towel right now on the PC. We're still spending an enormous amount on really great talent and people on the Macs of the future. And we have some really cool things coming out there. Because we believe as people walk away from the PC, it becomes clear that the Mac is what you want if you want a PC.

And [Phil Schiller](http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/23/5339100/phil-schiller-craig-federighi-interview-30th-anniversary-macworld):
> We don't waste time thinking, ‘But it should be one [interface!]' How do you make these [operating systems] merge together?' What a waste of energy that would be[..]. There's a role for the Mac as far as our eye can see.

Mix this with Cook's standard spiel about Apple releasing great products in late 2013 (like the Mac Pro, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, and Haswell/Iris MacBook Pro with Retina Display) and through 2014 (yet to come), and it's understandable that people are trying to guess what's to come from Apple.

### Samsung and Sony Walk, Apple Stand

Sony [recently announced](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/06/sony-vaio-sale/) that it will be spinning off or closing down its VAIO arm, the arm responsible for their Notebook and Desktop PC operations. 

Samsung are [rumoured](http://www.omgchrome.com/samsung-stop-making-windows-laptops/) to stop producing Windows Notebooks in 2014, focusing purely on Chromebooks.

At a time when the number of PCs being sold is declining, this isn't that big news. Companies are moving from markets that have matured, and focussing on those in which they have the most to gain. Standard business practice.

But where it becomes interesting, is when you look at Apple. Their part of the PC market - the high-end where the MacBook Air, iMac, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro reside - [is growing](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/01/09/gartner-pcmarket-statistics/). Sometimes only by single digit to low double digits % growth, sometimes by leaps and bounds, but ever growing.

### iOS spreads it wings

iPhone and iPad are launching in ever more countries. iPhone recently launched in China as a first wave country, for the first time ever. Apple have started working with the [country's largest mobile network](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/16/customers-rush-china-mobile-stores-for-iphone-launch), letting even more people buy iPhone. 

As an entry device, a way of getting you hooked on the Apple ecosystem, there's not much better than iPhone or iPad. The Apple way of doing things is about to become known to even more people.

## Return of the Mac

All of these point to a time where the Mac could rule the PC roost. With growing market share, a dwindling competitor landscape, and the entry drug that is iOS, Apple's commitment to spending more on this platform could very well pay off. 

The question remains: What are they spending all of this money on? What are they working on making better?

### Hardware

Look at the current Mac line.

MacBook Air: A notebook computer capable of doing pretty much all a normal person needs, and that can do it for 12 hours straight without breaking a sweat. 

MacBook Pro: A powerhouse in mobile computing power, displaying information using pixels that are so small the human eye can't see them, and that can still last for a working day without seeing a plug socket.

iMac: A full computer and display in a case that's only a inch thick at its thickest, and only a few millimetres at its edges.

Mac Pro: A workstation grade computer, in a tube that's 9 inches long, and 6 inches wide. 

To use an old phrase, they're all "Insanely Great!", and they're all available today. Hardware wise, we're pretty much done. (Though shiny new designs always go down well).

### Software

Mac OS X has been driving Mac hardware for over a decade. It's now version 10.9, or Mavericks to give it its full title. The basic features and design have been refined over the years, and lots has been added, but software could be where we see the most change in the Mac line.

Bringing feature parity between the Mac and iOS appears to be one of Apple's main aims. You can see this in the rewrite of iWork and iLife, the bringing of AirDrop to the iPhone, etc. Could we see more of this? We'll have to wait and see.

### Services

iCloud is a great idea, it just hasn't been executed as well as it could (similar to Google Glass ;)).

With their investment in data centers, I think Apple are working to remedy this. Using iCloud as a way to connect all Apple devices, softwares, and services together is almost definitely in the future of the Mac.

## Maybe it's not about the Mac, after all

Apple isn't about one product over another (though they definitely give preference to some devices when it comes to development, marketing $s, etc). It's about an experience.

It's about making a presentation on your Mac, editing it on the fly on your iPad, and presenting it wirelessly using your iPhone to an Apple TV.

It's about using the best device for the job at hand, and having a device that is reliable (concerns about iOS bugs and A7 crashes aside).

The Mac forms a part of this ecosystem. So does the iPhone and the iPad. So does Apple TV. And so does iCloud. So too will any future devices that Apple releases.

For all of these things to work how we want them, the Mac has to be at the top of its game. It has to have great hardware, software, design and services. We rely on it, and we need it to be reliable. 

All of this costs money, so maybe Apple are just working on making the Mac as great as it can be, the same as they are with everything else. And maybe we're reading into all of this far too much.

Only time will tell.
