There's been some discussion recently about the integrity of podcasters who accept payment for their work in the form of sponsorships. People questioned whether these podcasters would report on issues involving their sponsor. In essence, their integrity was scrutinised over events that have not yet happened.

I am not a podcaster, though I communicate with people who are, but I am involved in this discussion. Why? I work for [Typeform](http://www.typeform.com) as their Community Manager. Typeform sponsors the [Fiat Lux](http://www.fiatlux.fm) podcast network. 

I want to discuss this a little bit, but first I'd like to let you know the process we went through in setting up the sponsorship.

## The Process

I approached Ben Alexander, the man behind Fiat Lux, just before the launch of Typeform 1.0. I know Ben from Twitter, and knew that he was looking to start accepting sponsorship. He works hard to create great content, and it's only right he make some money from it.

After contacting Ben, I decided that Typeform would sponsor the Fiat Lux network for 16 shows. Ben made us aware how much the sponsorship would cost and what the expected listener numbers were. (I won't share those numbers here). Once agreed, Ben set about creating a script which he would use for the ad 'reads' during each episode. Once he had created the read and recorded a sample episode so we could hear what it would sound like, we signed off on everything.

We communicate with Ben to get an update on how the podcasts are doing, and so he can get data from us, like conversion rates. (Again, I won't share those numbers here). We work with him over any concerns either party has, and then we let him get on with doing his job: creating podcasts. 

The most interaction I have had with Ben was a 1 hour Skype call where Ben and I thrashed through some changes to  the message we want. We're a business after all, and making sure the right message gets to our potential customers is important.

## Houston, we had a problem

As with any launch of a major new product, Typeform's had a few hiccups. We're not perfect, but we worked to resolve any and all issues so that they didn't impact our users for too long. [On a recent episode of Cultivate](http://www.fiatlux.fm/cultivate/15), Ben and Jamie mentioned these issues whilst talking about Typeform.

Will I be contacting Ben and withdrawing our sponsorship or chastising him? No.

If we were to have a future issue whilst we were sponsoring Fiat Lux, would I expect Ben to ignore it? No.

What I would expect, as Ben is a professional, is that he would contact us to let us know that he would be covering the issue in an upcoming show. 

I would expect that he ask us for the information he needs to give the whole and correct story to his listeners. In this way, he would not be working with hearsay or assumptions. We would let him know what he needs to know. Ben covering the issue would the best we could ask for, as he would have the information direct from us. 

## It's about great content

It is not in our interests that Ben, Jamie or John skirt around an issue because we are sponsoring their shows. This does not reflect well on us. People are not stupid and they'll soon suss out why the issue is being tiptoed around, or hinted it.

It is in our interests that Ben and the other hosts of the Fiat Lux network continue to create great content. We sponsor this content because people listen to it.

It is not in Fiat Lux's best interests to work with sponsors who limit the content they can output. They have reputations on the line and an audience to do good by.

It is in Fiat Lux's best interests to create great content. Our sponsorship allows the team to continue creating great content. Content thousands of people download and listen to. Content we listen to.

I don't think I'm wrong in saying that this applies to all podcasts and all sponsors.

Sponsorship is a business transaction. As with any business transaction, there are expectations and ways of doing things. Sometimes what needs to be said isn't what we'd like to hear. But, we're all grown ups and we understand that in business, as with anything, the best thing to say is the truth.
