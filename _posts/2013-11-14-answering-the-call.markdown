It can be a right pain, trying to organise one-to-one meetings and calls. Emailing back and forth with people trying to lock down a time can take longer than the call itself. What if there was an easy way to do this?

### A call for help. A plan for an MVP.

Inspired by a tweet from [James Deer](https://twitter.com/jamesdeer/status/397299145666752512), we asked ourselves: How can we make it easy to schedule a meeting or call?

What is the essential information you need to send and get back to achieve this? We've narrowed it down to:

* Availability - When you'll be available, and for how long
* Duration - How long the meeting/call should take
* Information - Where the meeting is. What number to call. 

By simply telling Calls the above information, you generate a web page. This page can then be shared with whoever you plan to have a meeting or call with, and they can select a slot appropriate for them. You both get an email to confirm. Done!

We're working out pricing, etc at the moment. 

**Wanna help?**
