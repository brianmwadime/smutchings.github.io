Marketing clichés are ten a penny nowadays (see what I did there?). People using the same old hyperbole and marketing spiel to sell you on their new product. It’s not just apps, but that’s where we’ll focus today.

## 1. “Mobile-First”

We get it, you’re designing your app to work well on mobile devices. You’re leaving behind the constraints and dogma associated with the ‘old way of doing things’. But surely every app for a mobile device is designed with this idea in mind? The idea that it should work in a way that suits the device it runs on.

## 2. “Designed for Humans”

There are some big-name culprits for this one. If your app or service is for humans, it’s going to be designed for humans. Kapeesh? Nobody’s going to be looking at the tag line and thinking anything over than “Oh good, at least it wasn’t designed for dogs!” (Unless they’re looking at a dog bowl, with that tagline, then they’ll think it’s just as stupid).

## 3. “Game Changing”

Unless the game is “Don’t copy everyone else”, you’re not changing anything. If your app brings nothing new to the table, why does it exist? Your users will decide if this changes their lives, and no amount of splash page copy will convince them otherwise. The same can be said for ‘Paradigm Shift’.

## 4. The waiting list

This one got old really quickly. For the first day or two, the idea of being part of an exclusive group will drum up conversation and excitement for your app. After a week or so? People who are still in the waiting list just give up, and move on to something else.

A great example of this is Mailbox.app for the iPhone. Launched two weeks ago (at time of writing), there are currently 800,000 people waiting in line for access to the app. Some have been waiting since launch, and are starting to get very bored.

## 5. “We’re like ‘x’ for ‘y’”

Do we really need a Facebook for Crepe Paper Echidna Origami? I don’t think so! Whilst relating your service to something else can make it easy for your to users to understand what you are, it can make them question why they couldn’t just use the original service anyway. Why do I need to join, and give me info to, you when I can just create a ‘Crepe Paper Echidna Origami’ group on Facebook, where all my friends already are?

## 6. “Revolution”

I was going to include this under ‘Game Changing’, but it deserves a mention all of its own.

Just because you’re working to change a behaviour, or enhance an experience, it doesn’t mean you’re revolutionising it. I can’t count how many ‘Email revolutions’ we’ve gone through in the last year. Not everything is a revolution – very few things are – and people have used their inboxes as to-do lists since since the first email was sent. It’s more likely that what you’re doing is ‘evolution’ than ‘revolution’.

## 7. “Embracing Social”

People like socialising. We’ve been doing it for millions of years, and we’d do it even if your app didn’t ‘embrace social’. A quick look on Facebook or Twitter shows that people will screenshot your app/game and share that. You just have to look at the number of ’4 Pics 1 Word’ screenshots appearing when people get stuck on a word. Social is an expectation, a need, it isn’t to be marketed as a USP.

## 8. “Next Level”

Marketers seem to think that apps are like Pokemon, they have different levels and get better as they advance through them. Your new app does not take me to the next level, stairs do.

## 9. “Real-time”

This has to be one of the newest clichés to make it to this list, but it’s one that will soon be everywhere. We’re obsessed with knowing everything, everywhere, all of the time – and App marketers know this. They latch onto your insecurity about being a few seconds behind the rest of the world, and leech off of it whilst touting their new ‘real-time gallery, so you can quickly see who else is eating dessert right now’.

## 10. Top 10 Lists

They’re everywhere. You may even be reading one right now. You will see a Top 10 list as part of almost every App marketing campaign out there right now. Some release one a week, making sure you always know the 10 best ways to create origami echidna sculptures.

That’s enough from me. What would make it onto **your** list? Tweet me, [@smutchings](http://twitter.com/Smutchings).
