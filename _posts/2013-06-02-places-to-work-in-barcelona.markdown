Sankt Oberholz, Aunt Benny and Heroes, those are well-known places in Berlins startup and freelance scene to get work done. Places which are cozy and quiet, with decent wifi connection and full of likeminded geeks. Places, which are unfortunately rare in Barcelona. A city crowded with millions of tourists and cafes which are focused on making tourists happy (or emptying their pockets with over-prized coffee). If I don't have a recommendation in an unknown city, I usually go to Starbucks to have a place for a few hours, but those are equally crowded and you have to watch your stuff every second as professional pickpockets are just waiting to get their hands on your laptop, or phone, or whatever is lying around. It's difficult to focus on work if there's too much going on around and if there are many factors to pay attention to.

But once in a while, you can discover places which are not for tourists. With a great ambiente, lovely staff, affordable coffee and great cakes. One of these places is <a title="Cafe Bitte" href="https://www.facebook.com/bittebarcelona">Cafe Bitte</a>, which I spent most of my time in the last few weeks working on a project. The organic daily menu (11€), cafe and cakes make work there a delight. Initially the cafe was supposed to be named 'Cafe Mitte' in reference to Berlin Mitte, but unfortunately the name was already registered, the cafe hits the heart of a freelancer.

Despite the name, the cafe is not owned by Germans and you won't get far with German or English there, so you might want to look up the word for cake before you go there. Those are equally great as grandmas. After work, you can also enjoy a great mojito there.

The cafe is located at

<address>C/ Londres 87, Barcelona</address>which is between C/ Muntaner and C/ Casanova close to Metro Diagonal or Metro L5 Hospital Clínic. They have a nice <a title="Cafe Bitte" href="https://www.facebook.com/bittebarcelona">Facebook page</a>, <a title="Bitte Barcelona" href="http://bittebcn.blogspot.com.es">a blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bittebcn">tweet</a>.
