You’ve got the best idea in the world. Nobody has done it before, you’ve got it just right. Your designers have scrutinised every pixel, making sure not a single one is out of place. Your developers have triple checked every line of code, nothing can possibly cause a bug. Your ready to launch, right? Wrong.

Many fail to realise the importance of Copy (or words) in their App. They get blinded by the shiny pixels, excited by seeing it in action, and obsessed with getting their idea into the limelight. They forget that what your app says is just as important as what it looks and feels like. We forget that the words can have just as much of an impact, if not more. 

Why is this? It’s a case of ‘taking it for granted’. We can all talk. We can all read. We can all write. The problem is, we’re not all that good at it (even I’m not perfect), but we’re still willing to give it a try. We don’t feel that a skill as ‘trivial’ as writing should be outsourced. We don’t believe that we should pay for something we can do an adequate job at. 

We all understand the difference between design, and great design. Art and fine art. Food and fine cuisine. By taking this understanding, and applying it to the world of words, we can work to make all Apps better.

The words that are used in our Apps are one of the many ways we communicate our message to our users. They set the tone, the language, and the style for the ‘conversation’ that is about to happen. They make users feel welcome. They help them find their way around. They make it easy to know what’s gone wrong. By bringing this all together, they work to guide the user from the moment they open to your app, to when they return to their home screen. By using the right words for the right job, we ensure that this journey is an engaging one, one that people will want to repeat again and again.

So remember, before you release your App to the great wide world, make sure that the message it conveys is the one you want your users to hear. Make sure that your users are guided, and feel comfortable, as they use your app. Make sure they know what to do if something goes wrong. Make sure you use a Copywriter.
