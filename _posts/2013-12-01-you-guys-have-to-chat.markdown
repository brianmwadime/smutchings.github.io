If you've been following me on [Medium](http://medium.com/@Smutchings), you'll know I recently wrote about two online services that I've been using recently: [Zapier](http://zpr.io/Pq3v) and [Typeform](http://typeform.com). 

Zapier makes it really easy to link web services together, and make them do cool things. I currently use it to tweet everytime I update this blog, or add new customers (I'm a [freelance copywriter](http://samhutchings.co)) to my MailChimp list. 

Typeform is the easiest way I know to make beautiful, engaging forms. With options for hidden fields and logic jumps, Typeforms are very powerful. You can read about it more in my [review](https://medium.com/bitcolumns-medium/ba171a434ca8).

## What does this have to do with anything?
If you've been following either Typeform or Zapier over the last couple of weeks, you'll know Typeform is now one of the over 250 services that Zapier works with, meaning you can do even more with your forms.

But why am I bringing this up? Because of this email:

![Email between Me and Wade of Zapier and David of Typeform](/content/images/2013/Dec/Screenshot_2013_12_01_12_19_24.png)

And this reply:

![Wade's reply](/content/images/2013/Dec/Screenshot_2013_12_01_12_22_59.png)

That simple email started the ball rolling on what would become the Typeform integration into Zapier, expanding the value of both products. Products that I use. 

## It's about building links
I'm a believer that building links and connections is a vital skill for the future. As we move further along the road of the sharing economy, these sorts of connections will be incredibly valuable. 

It all starts with an email, and thinking "These people should be working together. That would be awesome!". I've done this a few times. The result is almost always positive.

**Don't be scared. Build connections. Make the world better!**
