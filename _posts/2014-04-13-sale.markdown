In Feburary, I moved to [live and work](http://blog.samhutchings.co/2014/02/28/hola-typeform/) in Barcelona, Spain. Some of the stuff I own in the UK just can't make the journey over with me, or I don't need any more because I've downsized.

The items listed here are for sale, at the price listed. These prices do not include getting the items to you, which you'll need to arrange. If you're intersted, [pop me an email](sam.hutchings@icloud.com).
