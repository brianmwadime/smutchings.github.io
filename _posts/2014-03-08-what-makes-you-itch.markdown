Thank about that for a second. Write it down if you have to. Sure that's what you want? Then do it!

Become an expert at it. Live life doing what you love, not what others want you to do. 

It won't happen overnight. You may find yourself failing again and again. Just make sure you learn and grow with every step, and every fall.

Don't worry about the money, if you're an expert in something you can make money from it. (Remember: Money is an enabler, not the goal! Happiness and a life well lived are the goals).

The world you were promised, it's a 9-5, Monday to Friday job with no prospects and just living for the weekend. It's not the world I want, and I'm sure it's not the world you want either.

Make something. Cause waves. Look to tomorrow!
