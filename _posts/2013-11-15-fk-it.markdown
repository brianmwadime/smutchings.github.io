Since leaving my job at Apple Europe in August of this year, I've spent the last 2 months moping and wondering what to do with myself. I've been trying to work out what to do next, and where I'm headed. I've been waiting for something to come along, I've applied for a couple of jobs, and I've just coasted along on the remaining funds I had from working for the last 5 years. 

But soon, these funds are going to run out, and I'm already feeling the sting. I need to make up my mind, pretty quickly, what I want to do. Luckily, this week, it kinda happened. 

## Work
I've spent the last 10 years creating great experiences for customers. Whether that be raking sand on a golf course, installing Sky in a customers house, showing someone how to get the most from their Mobile Phone, or helping and training Apple employees. 

I've spent the last 2 years helping people get their message across. I've worked with some truly amazing people and companies. People like [Marshall Haas](http://marshallhaas.com), [Ted Nash](http://tednash.co.uk), [Jon Wheatley](http://jonw.com), [Matt Willmott](http://www.mattwillmott.co.uk), and [more](http://www.samhutchings.co/portfolio). Companies like [SoftFacade](http://www.softfacade.com)and [codepotato](http://codepotato.co.uk). 

Everyone deserves a great experience. Everyone deserves for their message to be heard. I'm now looking for work that brings the two together. To join a company whose beliefs align with my own. Fingers crossed, I can make this happen very soon. 

## Community
I've become part of an online community that blows my mind each and every day. A community that has sprung up around the serendipitous nature of the web. One that couldn't exist without tools like Facebook, Twitter, and iMessage. The impact technology has had on my life can not truly be quantified.

I'm awestruck that there are people who see technology as a scary or evil things. That objects and services that bring so much benefit are struck off so easily is a travesty. We should be working to aleviate this.

I'm also scared for the future of technology, as more and more students leave school without a passion for the amazing things that we can do with technology, and just an obsession with BBM, Snapchat, and YouTube. Very few young people know how to program (I'm one of them), and that's a shame.

I love technology. I love sharing my love for technology. I know incredible people who do awesome things with technology. Perhaps I can make something work here.

## Travel
I've lived in the same corner of the same country for the past 24 years. I've travelled to a couple of places - Berlin, Nice, St. Louis, Feurteventura - but I'd very much like to expand that list over the coming years. New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Rome, Paris, Munich, and Cairo are just a few. Perhaps some off the beaten track travel should be looked into as well.

## Inspiration and Thanks
I've had some inspiring comments from and conversations with people this week. My heart goes out to each and every one of them. It's a major benefit of the community I've become a part of, we're always there for each other when things look their worst. I won't list them all out here, but they all know who they are. And I thank them each and every time I can. 

I'll leave you with this YouTube video. I hope that it inspires you as much as it did me (I was literally in tears as I listened to this for the 5th time).
