I found some time to create a new theme for my blog. Based on the <a href="http://lessframework.com/">Less Framework</a> the whole theme is responsive to the device with the CSS3 @media-selector, which means it will automatically change the width of the layout according to the device you're using, iPhone, iPod, iPad etc. The theme is based on <a href="http://2010dev.wordpress.com/">TwentyTen</a> and the semantic HTML5 theme <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/toolbox">Toolbox</a>, which saved me a lot of work. I have to fix some minor issues and will then share the theme on GitHub for free. Stay tuned.
