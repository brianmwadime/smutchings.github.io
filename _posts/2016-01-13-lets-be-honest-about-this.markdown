I've wanted to write this blog post - outlining the way I work, the tools I use, and what I charge -  for the last two years, but have been told time and time again that I shouldn't. 

For 2016, I want to try doing things a little differently (how can it hurt?), so I'm writing it. **This is a living document**, I'll update it every time there's a change to my rate, the systems I use, or anything else listed on this page. (I'll also look into a way to make it more central to my website going forward).

## The Way I Work


We all work in different ways. In an effort to control my life and not spend all of it working, I work in the following way:

- I work in 6-hour sprints, normally one per day, to allow me [time to decompress](https://medium.com/lessons-learned-1/it-attacks-from-within-d2f50e9da5ef#.ucf4usnrp) and enjoy life.

- I take a "No Bullshit" approach to working. That means that I will call things as I see them and expect the same courtesy from you. We don't get better by being pandered to.

- I'm open to working from your offices or a specific locale, but all expenses related to getting to and working from that locale will be passed on.

- If we're not working in the same place, I'll send you a weekly update email to keep you up-to-date with where we are at.

## The Tools I Use


I currently use the following tools:

### Harvest

[I use Harvest for time tracking, expense reporting, invoicing, and payments.](http://try.hrv.st/8-72883) Time is tracked using the OS X or iOS application and is used to check the actual time worked against the estimates given at the beginning of the project. This often will not affect the price you pay, but will allow me to better understand the time taken to do different tasks.

When you work with me, you'll be given a Client URL to use with Harvest, where you can see all of your invoices (past and present), pay them, and export them as a PDF for your records.

### GatherContent

Whilst it's not perfect, [I use GatherContent](http://gathercontent.com) for content creation, organisation and collaboration. It's ideal for structuring content and managing a content creation project, with page statuses and deadlines built in. Once the first draft is loaded, you can log in at any time and see how things are going. 


All it needs to add is synchronous editing support, and I'm golden.

### iWork

Apple's iWork suite of applications - Keynote, Numbers, and Pages - are great for staying productive at home and on the go. Linked by iCloud Drive, it lets me edit a document on the go and know the changes will be reflected on my Mac when I get home. Primarily used for PDF generation - proposals, contracts, etc.

### Slack

Slack has become the go-to application for instantaneous online communication. If you're using Slack with your team, I'll happily jump in. This helps me understand you and your company better.

### Skype

Great for synchronous communication such as text chats or audio calls. If we're having a call to start a project or give a status update, Skype is what I'll use. (If you don't like Skype for audio calls, FaceTime is possible).

### Email

Most of the communication I do on a day-to-day basis is through email. This asynchronous form of communication is best when working with busy people across the world as it respects them and their time.

### iCloud Drive

I store all contracts and work resources on iCloud Drive. This means that they're not solely on my Mac, giving an extra level of confidence in their integrity and availability in the case of an incident. 

### Dropbox

I use Dropbox solely with my accountant for synching invoices and expenses. 

### Google Drive

I'm happy to use Google Drive, through the web interface, when no other alternative will do.

## What I Charge and How

Money is one of the most difficult things to discuss when it comes to freelancers working with clients. So many questions whirl around - "Am I charging enough?", "Am I charging too much?", "Will this put the client off?" - and create a lot of stress and uncertainty at the beginning of a project. So, let's get rid of that back and forth. Here's what I charge and how:

- I charge £60 (about $75/€70) an hour.

- I work in 6-hour sprints (equivalent to 1 day's work) and projects are charged in this way. This means a day rate of £360 (about $440/€405).

- A deposit of 50% is required before a project begins.

- For projects taking under 2 weeks, a final invoice for the remaining 50% (or more, if the scope has changed) will be issued once the project has been completed, but before the work is handed over.

- For projects taking over 2 weeks, an invoice will be generated every two weeks, starting 14 days after the deposit is paid.

- Invoices may be paid by Credit/Debit Card (using Harvest's secure online payment page) or by Bank Transfer (IBAN details are on every issued invoice).

- Invoices are issued with Net 15 payment terms, meaning that payment is due 15 days after the invoice is issued. For example, an invoice issued on the 2nd of the month will be due for payment on the 17th of the month.

- Overdue payment carries a penalty of 20% of the invoice amount. You'll get a reminder a couple of days before the invoice is due.
