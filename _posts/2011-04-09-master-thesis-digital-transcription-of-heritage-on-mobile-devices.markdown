In February, I started the research for my MSc thesis with the current working title "Mobile Technology meets Vintage Literature - Tablets in Modern History". After talking to people from the University Library Leiden they expressed the need for a comfortable digital transcription interface within the special collections library. As I am interested in mobile technology, I proposed to create a prototype for this interface on the iPad2. There are quite a few transcription projects working at the moment which gave me the chance to speak to people within the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (Dutch Royal Library) Den Haag and the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (German National Library) about my work. The prototype should offer a easy-to-use interface like the <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper">Trove Digital Newspapers</a>, but in a smaller scale for Leiden University students.
