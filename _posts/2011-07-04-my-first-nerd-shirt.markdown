Some time ago I started using <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/">CouchBase</a> for the development of Transcribe.app, an iPad application to help users transcribe vintage literature into machine readable text, which is part of my Media Technology MSc. graduation. CouchBase is, as far as I know, the only document oriented database on iOS at the moment and they're putting a lot of effort in the product to make it enterprise ready. In the early versions it was quite complex to set up an app in xcode and since it took me several tries to get a fresh app running, I wrote down the process on how it worked. To this little documentation, Chris thanked me and sent me this cool shirt over from the States. As I never bought a computer- or computer related-shirt before and never got anything from other projects where I put in similar or more effort, this is quite a surprise and very much appreciated.

Thanks!
