I've something to announce. Something some of you may already know.

On the 6th of February 2014, I joined [Typeform](http://www.typeform.com), a young startup in the heart of Barcelona. I joined as their Community Manager. I'm their 17th employee, and work within their marketing department. I'm responsible for their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Typeform), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/Typeform), [Blog](http://hellotypeform.tumblr.com) and other properties.

This is my first experience of working in a startup, and it's been a great one. Typeform has a great culture, great people, and is lead by two very passionate founders. The team is small, and we're learning and changing with everything we do. There's no legacy processes of "way to do things" to stick to, and it's great.

I plan to write more about my experiences at Typeform, and my adventures in Spain. (Did I not mention? I moved to Spain on the day I joined Typeform).

This move means that I am not currently taking on new clients, for obvious reasons. It may be that once I'm settled in, I return to writing for other people beyond Typeform, but I'm not yet sure if this will be the case.

Here's to a new chapter,
