For the last couple of years, I've tried to thinkg of a theme/goal for the year ahead. Something to live by, in the hope that over time I can make myself a better person. 

In 2012 the goal was the try something new. I did this by starting to do more freelance writing, starting my own business, and travelling to America. 

For 2013 I went with quite a selfish goal: helping myself. I've written before about issues in my life, and I aimed for 2013 to be the year that I start working towards helping myself. I'll write more about that in another post. 

My goal for 2014 is well and truly cemented. I've started using it in my thinking already, and it plays a part in some of my plans for the year already. If you hadn't guessed from the title it's: **For The Next**. 

## For The Next?
I'm lucky to be uncle to my 4 lovely nieces and nephews. Seeing them grow is amazing. (Not having to be hands on when things go bad is even better). But seeing these inquisitive, imaginative minds develop has me worried. 

Those of you who follow me on Twitter, or who have met me recently, will be aware that I'm not a fan of the education system in this country. I'm not entirely sure why we're using a system devised many years ago to prepare children for a world that is drastically different to last year, let alone 10 or more years ago. 

I'm worried what the education system will do to these brilliant minds. I'm scared to see what will come out the other side, after 14 years of being told they're right or wrong, or to slow down or speed up. Fourteen years of [low-grade clerical work](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_how_to_escape_education_s_death_valley.html) would fill anyone with dread. 

Recently, I've heard many people say "We don't know where we're going to get the next wave of talent". Companies, large and small, are worried about where they will find their next hires, either as they grow or to replace people as they move on. I'm talking about companies such as game, web and app development studios. Companies that require a certain range of skills. 

They're worried that the graduates coming into the workplace, from school, college and university, are neither interested or qualified to pass the torch to. That there's noone good enough entering or in the market. 

## So Sam, what are you going to do?
I'm no developer. I'm not a designer. I'm a wordman with a lot of passion, and the beginnings of a network. 

I've already spoken to the great people at Create at Fruitworks about this subject. I'm hoping to talk to more people throughout 2014. My plan starts local, as any good plan should. 

### #CanterburyTechCity
Canterbury, my local city, has a lot of potential. With 35,000 students, there's a lot of bright people living and learning in Canterbury and the surrounding area. Many of these leave Canterbury soon after graduating, taking their skills with them.

Canterbury is also full of bright people. People working in development, scientific research and other technical fields. People working in design, publishing, and other creative fields. 

More needs to be done to bring these groups together. We should be waxing lyrical about them. Shouting from the rooftops about the great things happening here, and inspiring future generations to stay in Canterbury and East Kent, and make it better. 

I'm working with people to try and make #CanterburyTechCity a thing in 2014. If you'd like to join me, [get in touch](http://samhutchings.co/hireme/). 

### TEDxCanterbury
If you haven't heard of [TED](http://www.ted.com), where have you been? TED is about sharing great ideas across multiple disciplines. (TED is short for Technology, Entertainment, Design).

There appears to be a lot of interest in hosting a TEDx event in the east of Kent, so I'm going to do it. It's a hell of an undertaking, and I'm going to need a bit of help, but I'm certain it's worth it. 

I've already applied for the licence, and should find out if I've got it in January 2014. I've got ideas in mind for speakers, venue, and the format. The tagline/theme? "For the next..." of course. 

If you'd like to be involved with TEDxCanterbury, be it as a sponsor, volunteer, attendee or speaker, [get in touch](http://samhutchings.co/hireme/).

## Over to you
I wanted to share my plan with you, as I share many things. Now it's your turn: What is your theme for the year ahead? What do you plan to do in 2014 that makes you a better person, makes our world a better place, or that you've just not been able to do before.

I'd love to know, so do [email](http://samhutchings.co/hireme) or [tweet](http://twitter.com/smutchings) me.
