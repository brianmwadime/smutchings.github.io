I've blogged on and off now for a couple of years, and I thought I'd share some of the lessons I've learnt. Observations of what seems to have worked on my blog. 

## Share what you've learnt

Many startups have embraced this, and use their blog as a way of disseminating lessons they have learnt and knowledge they have acquired from the process of working on their products. 

[37signals](https://37signals.com/) use '[Signal vs. Noise](https://37signals.com/svn/)' to this end. They share many their learnings, and their knowledge attracts many visitors.  

## Strike up a conversation

It may be that you don't have some learnings to share. In which case, why not learn something from your audience? Strike up a conversation. Get them involved (as long as you have an active community already). 

Get their opinion on your latest project. Ask them what troubles them, and what you could do to fix this problem. It's up to you, really.

## Write as you speak

I used to believe that 'I need to write my blogs in longhand prose, using an authoritative and serious tone. I can't inject humour, that's a weakness." Turns out, I was dead wrong. Writing in the same style as I speak has two advantages:

* I can write a lot more quickly, and get better results.
* People start to understand my tone. They know when I have written something, or when I have not. 

## Update regularly

Don't leave your blog abandoned for months at a time. But, don't also fill it with random stuff just for the sake of updating. 

If your blog has been quiet for nearly two months, question whether you really need it on your site. Could the same thing be done by updated somewhere else? 

If you're uploading your office's favourite cat photos and music playlists just to have enough content to update regularly, is a blog really the best way to do this? Would this sort of activity be better suited for your Social Network pages, where people expect this sort of feed, and it flows through to them?

## Check before you publish

Before you publish, you need to check:

* Spelling and grammar. Whilst the odd error is forgivable, it's best to get it as right as you can
* The facts. Make sure what you are posting is true. You're reputation relies on it. You don't want people thinking of your blog as a tabloid.
* The message. When you click 'Publish' is the message your readers get, the one you want to convey? (I'll have more about this in an upcoming post. One I've tried to write for the last two weeks. Getting the message right can be quite hard).
