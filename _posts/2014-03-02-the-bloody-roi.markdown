When Steve Jobs passed in October of 2011 (The day after my 22nd birthday), there was one question on everyone's lips: "Has Apple been left in the best hands?"

For the last 29 months this has been repeated again and again, as the leadership of Tim Cook is questioned at each and every step he takes. The hiring, and subsequent firing, of Dixon's John Browett. The ousting of Scott Forstall. The release of iOS 7. The rebuilds of iWork and iLife. The lack of iWatch and Apple TV set 3 months into 2014. 

Personally, I've believed from August 2011, when Tim Cook took over Apple as CEO, that he was the right man for the job. Jobs knew he was going to die. He knew his time on this earth was limited, and I have no doubt that he took steps to make sure what he brought to Apple was alive in every one of the executive team who survived him. He knew that, creatively at least, Apple was in good hands.

## There's something about him

It was Jobs who chose Cook as his successor. It was he who saw the potential of Cook to take Apple to new heights, and this week, I think we found out why. 

Tim is normally a composed man. He excels at giving calculated and considered answers to questions posed to him. He takes a leaf from Jobs' book, taking a moment to think and consider before answering a question. Whether at All Things D or on a company conference call, he has his tone and his way of putting things.

The latest Apple shareholder meeting saw that composure thrown out, when passion took over, when an advocate for the NCPRR (National Center for Public Policy Research) asked that Apple release detailed information on all the environmental and social programs it has, and abandons those in favour in only working in areas that bring profit to the company. 

This opinion was not taken lightly by Tim. As reported by [MacObserver](http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/tim-cook-soundly-rejects-politics-of-the-ncppr-suggests-group-sell-apples-s), his reply was something along these lines: 

>What ensued was the only time I can recall seeing Tim Cook angry, and he categorically rejected the worldview behind the NCPPR's advocacy. He said that there are many things Apple does because they are right and just, and that a return on investment (ROI) was not the primary consideration on such issues.

>"When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind," he said, "I don't consider the bloody ROI." He said that the same thing about environmental issues, worker safety, and other areas where Apple is a leader.

## That sealed the deal for me
If you've followed or known me for any amount of time, you'll know that I believe that Apple is not like many businesses. The company and its employees believe in doing things differently, and in doing the best they can. 

This outburst of passion from someone at the top of the company confirms to me that Apple is the same it always has been: a company that believes that doing everything the best you can is the way to be a great business.

By making great products, creating experiences that are unparalleled in the technology space, and working to leave the planet in a better state then they found it, Apple have a dedicated customer base. One that many companies wish they had, no matter how much they take the piss out of them in their adverts, and one that ensures that Apple isn't going away any time soon.

January 24 marked the 30th Anniversary of the Mac. The world of technology has changed a lot in those 30 years, and Apple has had a bumpy journey to get where they are today. Their devotion to make great products has continued, through the return of Jobs in 1997, and this lives on in Tim Cook. Here's to the next 30 years, and all that they may bring in the world of Mac, Apple, and technology. 

I believe we'll be looking back at today and wondering why we ever questioned Tim Cook. I just hope I'm not wrong.
