<center>I get asked the question a lot, so I'd thought I'd take some time to answer it here. I'll probably have to keep answering it, but at least I can point some of those people in this direction. 

## My Gateway Drug
For my 15th Birthday, in October of 2004, I was bought a Packard Bell MP3 player. It had a tiny screen (which I broke whilst rolling down a hill with it in my pocket), you added music to it using Windows Media Player, and the headphones were awful. If I remember correctly, it had about 512MB of storage, which was pretty nifty at the time for a device so tiny. Here's a pic:

It was after I rolled down a hill with it in my pocket that my Dad took it back, and managed to convince the clerk that it was a manufacturing fault, and he exchanged it for an iPod Shuffle, my first ever Apple product.

To say that it was different from the Packard Bell player was an understatement. Gone was the flimsy screen. Gone was the annoying USB lead. Gone was Windows Media player. The iPod Shuffle was a completely new experience for me. One that suited me perfectly for my job (raking bunkers on a golf course did not do a screen good), and one that hooked me on the Apple experience.

## One Year Later
The following year, 2006, I was annoyed that I wasn't using my iPod Shuffle as much as I should be. My 17th birthday had just passed, and as all teenagers flush with cash do, I wanted to buy something. Thinking that the Shuffle's lack of storage space was limiting my use of it, I decided to upgrade to the 5th Gen iPod.

It turns out I was right. With 30 Gigabytes of storage (more than my laptop had at the time), the iPod never left my pocket. It still works to this day, I gave it to my Aunty a year or so back because she wanted a music player.

## The iPhone Years
When the iPhone came out, I was too poor to afford it outright, and too young to get it on a contract. When the iPhone 3G came out, I was one of the ones queued up outside my local [O2](http://www.o2.co.uk) store waiting for the doors to open. An hour after opening, I left the shop with a shiny new iPhone 3G 8GB, a phone that would serve me well for 2 years. 

Coming from other smartphones, such as the O2 XDA series, and my previous handset, the LG Viewty, the iPhone was a breath of fresh air. A device with such usability and speed, I had never known. 

Since that introduction to the iPhone in 2008, I've owned the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 (all in black). I've tried other smartphones, but none work for me as well as the iPhone. I'll be buying a 6 this year, possibly going larger than 16GB for the first time.

## Bring on the Mac

In the summer of 2009, I was lucky enough to win a MacBook Pro. I took delivery of it in mid June, and used it alongisde my Dell XPS for a couple of weeks, to see which one I prefered. Two weeks into owning the MacBook Pro, it was clear, I was a Mac guy. The XPS was swiftly passed fown to my Step Father, and I've used Macs ever since.

In Autumn of that year, I financed an iMac. A Mac that I still own, but not for long. (Moving it to Barcelona will be a pain, and my Air runs better than it does).

In August of 2013, whilst working at Apple, I upgraded to the new 13" MacBook Air, and I'm impressed by how much Apple can fit into such a tiny shell.

## I had an iPad
I got the original iPad in 2010. It was the first tablet to work out what people wanted from such a form factor, and I loved it. It's still being used. I gave it to my mum last year, and her and my nephew love using it.

I upgraded to the 3rd generation iPad, the first with a Retina Display, at launch. I sat up waiting for the shop to come back online, ordered with "Stay hungry. Stay foolish." engraved on the back, and got it on release day. I sold it in mid-2013, in anticipation of buying the inevitable new iPad, which would turn out to be the iPad Air, but that never happened. I'm hoping to replace it this year, once the cost of moving country has been settled.

## So why do I buy Apple?
Oh yeah, that was the point of this.</center>

It all boils down to these points:

- **I get Apple, and Apple get me.** I find that I work better with Apple's devices, and enjoy them more than I do devices from any other manufacturer
- **Customer service.** I've yet to have bad customer experience with Apple. My iMac had some issues when it was delivered, all was resolved and I got Â£120 worth of free stuff with it when it was all sorted. I'm on my 6th iPhone 5, but at every step every thing has been done to make sure that everything is sorted. Bad luck on my part, great service on Apple's.
- **Great design.** I don't need to say anything on this.
- **iCloud.** This is an important part. iCloud, and the Apple ecosystem, gives you super powers. I can use the iPhone as a remote for my Apple TV, whilst also streaming media to that Apple TV from my Mac or iPhone. My iPhone backs up everything to iCloud, and a lot of my apps store their data on it. This mostly seemless integration is second to none in the current market.
- **Confidence.** Apple have yet to show to me that I should have anything but the utmost confidence in how they conduct their business and what they do with my data. Principles of other companies, such as Samsung and Facebook, raise questions and concerns with me constantly. I truly believe, and believe that there is evidence, Apple truly do believe what they say they believe, and are working to see those beliefs come to fruition.

I'm sure there are other elements I'm forgetting, and I'm sure you'll all have counter-points to everything I've written (notice I don't have comments on this site).

I'm always up for a conversation [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Smutchings), if you'd like to be beaten into submission about how great Apple are ;).
