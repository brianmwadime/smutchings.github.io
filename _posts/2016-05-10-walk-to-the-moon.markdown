> "Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind- bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space." - Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

At any given time, the distance between the Earth and Moon is about 373,387 kilometres. It's quite the distance. But, could you walk it? Maybe get there at a steady job? That's the idea behind _Walk to the Moon_, a personal walking tracking app and community concept.

### The Numbers Behind Walk to the Moon

According to [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com), the typical human walking speed is 4 kilometres per hour and life expectancy in the western world hovers at around 80 years. That means that if you walked for 3 hours per day (doesn't need to all be in one burst) each and every day, you could possibly reach the moon before you die.

If you run, the numbers are a bit more optimistic. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running) pegs human running speed at about 6 metres per second, or 20 kilometres per hour. That means you could run from Earth to the Moon for about 36 minutes a day. Of course, you can't run everyday through your life, so the number is likely more like an hour, but it's possible.

Given that you're pretty active, it is in entirely possible for a person to walk, jog or run to the moon in their lifetime.

## The App and Community

As I said earlier _Walk to the Moon_ is an application and community. The idea is to track your movement during the day using the sensors in your iPhone and/or Apple Watch and map these to the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Your ultimate goal, to make it to the Moon on a solo walk.

Along the way, you'll unlock space and exploration related achievements and badges. Walked the length of the Space Shuttle (37 metres), you'll get a badge. Walked once around the Earth? That's a badge!

In the famous words of Douglas Adams, "Space is Big". And for that reason, walking to the Moon is the only reasonable expectation for a single person in their lifetime. But... The power of community can allow us to do amazing things together. So, as well as being a personal tracking app, all distances walked would be anonymously collated and brought into a main walking pool, as the _Walk to the Moon_ community make their way across the Solar System (first to Mars) and then across the universe (if the numbers ever get big enough).

## Bringing it together into an Experience

Above, you can try out my first _Walk to the Moon_ prototype for yourself. Some of the interactions aren't easy to replicate in Marvel, for example the badge list scrolling, so below is a video of what this would look like on an actual device and in the app.

_Walk to the Moon_ is my first attempt at bringing together an idea, UI and UX into a testable prototype. If you'd like to work with me to develop this project out, or you'd like to buy the idea, [get in touch!](mailto:hi@samhutchings.co?subject=Let's walk to the moon)
